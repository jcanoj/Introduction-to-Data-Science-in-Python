    "Let's start with how to merge data sets. We've already seen how we add new data to an existing DataFrame. We simply use the square bracket operator with the new column name, and the data is added as long as an index is shared. If there is no shared index and a scalar value is passed in, which remember a scalar value is just a single value like an integer or a string. The new value column is added with the scalar value as the default value. What if we wanted to assign a different value for every row? Well, it gets trickier. If we could hardcode the values into a list, then pandas will unpack them and assign them to the rows. But if the list we have isn't long enough, then we can't do this, since Pandas doesn't know where the missing values should go. "

    "An idiomatic solution is often one which has both high performance and high readability. This isn't necessarily true. A sort of sub-language within Python, Pandas has its own set of idioms. We've alluded to some of these already, such as using vectorization whenever possible, and not using iterative loops if you don't need to. Several developers and users within the Panda's community have used the term pandorable for these idioms. I think it's a great term. So, I wanted to share with you a couple of key features of how you can make your code pandorable. "

    "We saw that previously, you could **chain pandas calls** together when you're querying DataFrames. For, instance if you wanted to select rows based on index like county name. Then you wanted to only project certain columns like the total population, you can write a query, like df.loc[“Washtenaw”][“Total Population”] This is a form of chaining, called **chain indexing. And it's generally a bad practice**. Because it's possible that pandas could be returning a copy or a view of the DataFrame depending upon the underlying NumPy library. In his descriptions of idiomatic Pandas patterns developer Tom Osberger described a rule of thumb for this. If you see back to back square brackets, then you should think carefully if you want to be doing chain indexing. I think this is great as a sort of code smell or anti pattern. "

Here's an example of two pieces of code in pandas using our census data."

In this code, there's no in place flag being used and you can see that when we first run a where query, then a dropna, then a set_index, and then a rename. You might wonder why the whole statement is enclosed in parentheses and that's just to make the statement more readable. In Python, if you begin with an open parentheses, you can span a statement over multiple lines and things read a little bit nicer. "

There's nothing wrong with this code in the functional sense, you might even be able to understand it better as a new person to the language. It's just not as pandorable as the first example. Now, the key with any good idiom is to understand when it isn't helping you. In this case, you can actually time both methods and see that the latter method is faster. So, this is a particular example of a classic time readability trade off."

    "We've seen that even though pandas allows us to **iterate over every row in a DataFrame this is generally a slow way** to accomplish a given task and it's not very pandorable. For instance, if we wanted to write some code to iterate over all the of the states and generate a list of the average census population numbers. We could do so using a loop in the unique function. Another option is to use the DataFrame **groupby** function. This function **takes some column name or names and splits the DataFrame up into chunks based on those names, it returns a DataFrame groupby object** which can be iterated upon, and then returns a tuple where the first item is the group condition, and the second item is the data frame reduced by that grouping. Since it's made up of two values, you can unpack this, and project just the column that you're interested in, to calculate the average. "

    "99% of the time, you'll use group by on one or more columns. But **you can actually provide a function to group by as well and use that to segment your data**. This is a bit of a fabricated example but lets say that you have a big batch job with lots of processing and you want to work on only a third or so of the states at a given time. We could create some function which returns a number between zero and two based on the first character of the state name. Then we can tell group by to use this function to split up our DataFrame. It's important to note that in order to do this you need to set the index of the DataFrame to be the column that you want to group by first. "

If it's a capital Q we'll return a 1 and otherwise we'll return a 2. Then we'll pass this function to the DataFrame apply, and see that the DataFrame is segmented by the calculated group number. This kind of technique, which is sort of a light weight hashing, is commonly used to distribute tasks across multiple workers. Whether they are cores in a processor, nodes in a supercomputer, or disks in a database. A common work flow with groupby is that you split your data, you apply some function, then you combine the results. This is called split apply combine pattern. "

    "\n",
    "The next scale is the **interval scale**. In the interval scale the measurement units are equally spaced like the ratio scale. But there's no clear absence of value. That is there isn't a true zero, and so operation such as multiplication and division are not valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the interval scale might be the **temperatures measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit**. Since there's never an absence of temperature and 0 degrees is a meaningful value of temperature.An example of the interval scale might be the temperatures measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Since there's never an absence of temperature and 0 degrees is a meaningful value of temperature.**The direction on a campus** might be another good example where 0 degrees on the campus doesn't indicate a lack of direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the work you do at data mining, the differences between the ratio and interval scales might not be clearly apparent or important than the algorithm you're applying. But it's important to have this clear in your mind when you're applying advanced statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next scale is the **ordinal scale**, and this is also important. In the ordinal scale the order of values is important but the differences between the values are not equally spaced. Here the a grading method that is used in many classes at the University of Michigan as a great example, where letter grades are given with pluses and minuses. But when you compare this to percentage values you see that a letter by itself covers 4% of the available grades and that a letter with a plus or minus is usually just 3% of the available grades. Based on this, it would be odd if there were as many students who received an A plus or A minus as there were who received a straight A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal data** is very common in machine learning and can sometimes be a challenge to work with. The last scale I'll mention is the **nominal scale** which is often just called categorical data. Here the **names of teams in a sport** might be good example. There are a limited number of teams but changing their order or applying mathematical function to them is meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why did I stop talking about Pandas and jump into this discussion of scale. Well, given how important they are in statistics and machine learning, Pandas has a number of interesting functions to deal with converting between measurement scales."

    "Sometimes it's useful to represent categorical values as each being a column with a true or a false as to whether that category applies. This is especially common in feature extraction. Variables with a Boolean value are typically called **dummy variables**. And pandas has a **built-in function called get_dummies, which will convert the values of a single column into multiple columns of 0's and 1's, indicating the presence of a dummy variable.**\n",

And we'll take a look at histograms in the second course in this specialization.\n",

    "Let's go back to our census data for an example. We saw that we could group by state, then aggregate to get a list of the average county size by state. If we further apply cut to this with say 10 bins, we can see that the states listed as categoricals using the average county size. Here we see the states like Alabama and Alaska fall into the same category, while California and the District of Colombia fall into a very different category. Now, **cutting is just one way** to build categories from your data, and there's many other methods. For instance, cut gives you interval data, where the spacing between each category is equal sized. But sometimes you want to form **categories based on frequency**. You want the **number of items in each bin to be the same, instead of the spacing between bins**. It really depends on the shape of your data and what you're planning to do with it."

    "For instance, let's say we wanted to **compare the makes of electric vehicles versus the years and that we wanted to do this comparison in terms of battery capacity**. To do this, we tell pandas we want the values to be kilowatts, the index to be the year and the columns to be the make. Then we specify that the aggregation function, and here we'll use the NumPy mean. Here's the results. We see there are NaN values for vendors who didn't have an entry in a given year like Ford in 2012. And we see that most vendors don't have a change in battery capacity over the years, except for Tesla, as they've introduced several new models. "
