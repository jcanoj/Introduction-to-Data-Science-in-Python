When a coin is flipped it has a probability of landing heads up and a probability of landing tails up. If we flip a coin many times we collect a number of measurements of the heads and tails that landed face up and intuitively we know that the number of times we get a heads up will be equal about the number of times we get a tails up for a fair coin. If you flipped a coin a hundred times and you received heads each time you'd probably doubt the fairness of that coin. We can consider the result of each flip of this coin as a **random variable.** "

Let's say the chance of a tornado here in Ann Arbor on any given day, is 1% regardless of the time of year. That's higher than realistic but it makes for a quicker demo.

    "One of the properties of this distribution is that the **mean is zero**, and that the two curves on either side are symmetric. I want to introduce you to the term **expected value**. I think that most of us are familiar with the mean is the sum of all the values divided by the total number of values. Calculating a mean value is a computational process, and it takes place by looking at samples from distribution. For instance rolling a die three times might give you the numbers 1, 2 and 6, the mean value is then 4.5. **The expected value is the probability from the underlying distribution**. It is what would be the mean of a die roll if we did an infinite number of rolls. The result is 3.5 since each face of the die is equally likely to appear. Thus the expected value is 3.5, while the mean value depends upon the samples that we've taken, and converges to the expected value given a sufficiently large sample set. A second property is that the **variance of the distribution** can be described in a certain way. The variance is **a measure of how badly values of samples are spread out from the mean**. Let's get a little bit more formal about five different characteristics of distributions. First, we can talk about the **distributionâ€™s central tendency**, and the measures we would use for this are **mode, median, or mean**. This characteristic is really about **where the bulk of probability is in the distribution**. We can also talk about the **variability in the distribution**. There are a couple of ways we can speak of this. **The standard deviation** is one, the **interquartile range** is another. **The standard deviation is simply a measure of how different each item, in our sample is from the mean.** "

This distribution has two high points, so we call it **bimodal**. These are really interesting distributions and **happen regularly in data mining**. A useful insight is that **we can actually model these using two normal distributions with different parameters**. These are called **Gaussian Mixture Models** and are particularly useful when **clustering data**. "

    "We use statistics in a lot of different ways in data science. In this lecture, I want to refresh your knowledge of **hypothesis testing**, which is a core data analysis activity behind experimentation. We're starting to see experimentation used more and more commonly outside of academic scientific, and in day to day business environments. Part of the reason for this is the rise of big data and web commerce. It's now easy to change your digital storefront and deliver a different experience to some of your customers, and then see how those customer actions might differ from one another. For instance, if you sell books, you might want to have one condition where the cover of the book is featured prominently on the web page and another condition where the focus is on the author and the reviews of the book. This is often called **A/B testing**. And while it's not unique to this time in history, it's now becoming so common that if you're using a website, you are undoubtedly part of an A/B test somewhere. This raises some interesting **ethical questions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A hypothesis is a statement that we can test**. I'll pull an example from my own research area of educational technology and learning analytics. Let's say that we have an expectation that when a new course is launched on a MOOC platform, the keenest students find out about it and all flock to it. Thus, we might expect that those students who sign up quite quickly after the course is launched will have higher performance than those students who signed up after the MOOC has been around for a while. In this example, we have samples from two different groups which we want to compare. The early sign ups and the late sign ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do hypothesis testing, we **hold out that our hypothesis as the alternative and we create a second hypothesis called the null hypothesis**, which in this case would be that there is no difference between groups. We then examine the groups to determine whether this null hypothesis is true or not. \n",
    "If we find that there is a difference between groups, then we can reject the null hypothesis and we accept our alternative. There are subtleties in this description. We aren't saying that our hypothesis is true per se, but we're saying that there's evidence against the null hypothesis. So, we're more confident in our alternative hypothesis. \n",

    "So, is this enough to go ahead and make some interventions to actually try and change something in the way we teach? When doing hypothesis testing, **we have to choose a significance level as a threshold** for how much of a chance we're willing to accept. **This significance level is typically called alpha**. It can vary greatly, depending on what you're going to do with the result and the amount of noise you expect in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, **in social sciences research, a value of 0.05 or 0.01 is often used**, which indicates a tolerance for a probability between 5% and 1% of chance. **In a physics experiment where the conditions are much more controlled and thus, the burden of proof is much higher, you might expect to see alpha levels of 10 to the negative 5 or 100,000th of a percentage.**"

    "You can think of the significance level from the perspective of interventions as well and this is something I run into regularly with my research. What am I going to do when I find out that two student populations are different? For instance, if I'm going to send an email nudge to encourage students to continue working on their homework, that's a pretty low-cost intervention. Emails are cheap and while I certainly don't want to annoy students, one extra email isn't going to ruin their day. But what if the intervention is a little more involved, like having our tutorial assistant followup with a student via phone? This is all of a sudden much more expensive for both the institution and for the student. So, I might want to ensure a higher burden of proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "So **the threshold you set for alpha depends on what you might do with the result, as well**. For this example, let's use a threshold of 0.05 for our alpha or 5%. Now, how do we actually test whether these means are different in Python? The **SciPy library contains a number of different statistical tests and forms a basis for hypothesis testing in Python**. A **t-test is one way to compare the means of two different populations**. In the SciPy library, the **ttest_ind function will compare two independent samples to see if they have different means**. I'm not going to go into the details of any of this statistical tests here, but instead, we'd recommend that you check out the Wikipedia page on particular test or consider taking a full statistics course if this is unfamiliar to you. But I do want to note that most statistical tests expect that **the data conforms to a certain distribution, a shape**. So, you shouldn't apply such tests blindly and should investigate your data first."

    "Well, that's much closer, but still beyond our threshold value. It's important to stop here and talk about **serious process problem with how we're handling this investigation** of the difference between these two populations. **When we set the alpha to be 0.05, we're saying that we expect it that there will be positive result, 5% of the time just due to chance**. As we run more and more t-tests, we're more likely to find a positive result just because of the number of t-tests we have run.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a data scientist runs many tests in this way, it's called **p-hacking or dredging and it's a serious methodological issue**. P-hacking results in **spurious correlations instead of generalizable results**. There are a couple of different ways you can deal with p-hacking. The first is called the **Bonferroni correction**. In this case, you simply tighten your alpha value, the threshold of significance, based on the number of tests you're running. So if you choose 0.05 with 1 test, and you want to run 3 tests, you reduce alpha by multiplying 0.05 by one-third to get a new value of 0.017. I personally find this approach to be very conservative. Another option is to **hold out some of your data for testing to see how generalizable your result is**. In this case, we might take half of our data for each of the two DataFrames, run our t-test with that, form specific hypothesis based on the result of these tests, then run very limited tests on the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This method is actually heavily used in machine learning when building predictive models**, where it's called cross fold validation. A final method which has come about is the **pre-registration** of your experiment. \n",
    "In this step, you would **outline what you expect to find and why, and describe the test that would backup a positive proof of this**. You register it with a third party, in academic circles, this is often a journal who determines whether it's a reasonable test to run or not. You then run your study and report the results, regardless as to whether they were positive or not. Here, there is a larger burden on connecting to existing theory since you need to convince reviewers that the experiment is likely to test fully a given hypothesis. In this lecture, we've discussed just some of the basics of hypothesis testing in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "I introduced you to the SciPy library, which you can use for t-testing. We've discussed some of the practical issues which arise from looking for statistical significance. There's much more to learn about hypothesis testing. For instance, there are different tests used, depending on the shape of your data, and different ways to report results instead of just p-values, such as confidence intervals. But I hope this gives you a start to comparing the means of two different populations, which is a common task for data scientists, and we'll followup some of this work in the second course in this series."
